                            <p>Google Analytics. This Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Site, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this Site. You can refuse the use of Google Analytics and opt out of having your information used by Google Analytics by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/. An opt-out cookie will be set on the computer, which prevents the future collection of your data when visiting this Site. Further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy can be found at: http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/gb.html Please note that on this Site, Google Analytics code is supplemented by Google to ensure an anonymized collection of IP addresses (so called IP-masking). In addition, we also use Google Search Console to monitor and fine tune how Google search indexes and ranks our content. Search console does not use cookies, login or other information. Further information concerning the terms and conditions of use and data privacy can be found at: https://privacy.google.com/</p>
